## General Information

- TunePad Link: [https://tunepad.com/project/90817](https://tunepad.com/project/90863)
  
- Within the code, #Piano piece marks the part of code that applies to the piano sector of the music and #Drum piece applies to that of the drums.

- The '#Phrase _' titles mark the commencement of different musical phrases, noted in text but more easily recognisable by ear.

- Each '#bar _' denotes that a line of code commences in a specific bar on the TunePad code.


## Technologies Used

- This project employs TunePad code technology, mainly using commands such as 'playNote', 'rest', and 'sustain', as well as controlling the length of notes within their brackets.

- More specifically, the 'playNote([])' command is used often to play multiple notes at one time.


## Setup

- There are no downloads or instalments necessary to run this code. All that is required to run TunePad is an internet connection and working speakers to hear the tune.


## Usage

To run this code, simply follow the TunePad link proivided above, navigate to the top right hand corner and select the black 'play' arrow. Enjoy the tune!


## Project Status

This is a completed project.


## Room for Improvement

- This code could be improved by having the drums run all the way through and coding the entire song rather than the first minute alone.
